A game where you're the leader of the "free world". Sign bills with legislators, work with indigenous groups, listen to activists, penalize companies and more to maximize a happy and healthy population. As for the climate... you can't really be healthy or happy in an inhospitable world ðŸ™ƒ.

#### Disclaimer: This game is in early, active development. It's probably pretty broken.

## Design

This is a single-player, story-based strategy game. There are two intertwined game genres involving the player simultaneously. The first is a clicker game built to simulate the economy in motion while the second involves legislators, activists, and more who interact with you according to a script and "random" event system. When decisions are made in the latter "Decision Screen", the former "Clicker Economy" is affected. The output of the **Clicker Economy** over time determines your overall score. The population will continually grow based on economic factors and your own decisions. A growing population means youâ€™ll need always need to evolve your strategy!

If you'd like to influence any part of the design, please add new or open existing issues under the [design label](https://github.com/thebritican/climate-game/labels/design).

### How To Win

At the end of either a) a timed game or b) a number of dialogue options - youâ€™ll receive an aggregate score. That score is calculated as the product of time, happiness, and healthiness for your citizens. You can compare your score against othersâ€™ on the online all-time high scoreboard!

## Audience

First release: USA grades K-4 (ages 5-9).

Next release: any age.
