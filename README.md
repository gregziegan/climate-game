# Climate Game

A game where you're the leader of the "free world". Sign bills with legislators, work with indigenous groups, listen to activists, penalize companies and more to maximize a happy and healthy population. As for the climate... you can't really be healthy or happy in an inhospitable world ðŸ™ƒ.

## Design

This is a single-player, story-based strategy game. There are two intertwined game genres involving the player simultaneously. The first is a clicker game built to simulate the economy in motion while the second involves legislators, activists, and more who interact with you according to a script and "random" event system. When decisions are made in the latter "Decision Screen", the former "Clicker Economy" is affected. The output of the **Clicker Economy** over time determines your overall score. The population will continually grow based on economic factors and your own decisions. A growing population means youâ€™ll need always need to evolve your strategy!

### How To Win

At the end of either a) a timed game or b) a number of dialogue options - youâ€™ll receive an aggregate score. That score is calculated as the product of time, happiness, and healthiness for your citizens. You can compare your score against othersâ€™ on the online all-time high scoreboard!

## Audience

First release: USA grades K-4 (ages 5-9).

Next release: any age.

## Contributing

Contributing doesn't just mean code! Feel free to play test the game and provide feedback via the issues tab.

If you're looking for something to work on, look for open issues and assign yourself! Assigning yourself will ensure multiple contributors don't work on the same thing.

**Note** There's a template provided to help structure the conversation a bit, but feel free to delete the text and just write without one.

### Art

The game needs tons of art! Ideas for contribution below:

#### Decision Screen

* Location backdrops
* Character design (portraits of the folks you talk to)
* Bills, pens, and othe political props

#### Clicker Economy

* An animated earth that demonstrates the state of the climate
* Character design for different jobs (farmer, doctor, etc)
* Schools to click on for training people

### Writing

The more unique and meaningful interactions with other characters, the more interesting the game will become. If you're interested in writing for an original or existing character, please make an issue and propose your ideas.

### Coding

See [the Onboarding guide](./dev-docs/onboarding.md) for technical set-up.

### Audio Engineering

If you know something about audio or want to learn: the game currently has **zero** sound effects!

Here are some audio examples we could use:

* common conversational sounds
  * sighs, laughs, etc
* satisfying feedback for clicking options in dialogue
* menu navigation sounds
* pen scribbling (signing legislation)
* "game over" music
* background music for different locations
  * political institutions like the oval office, congress, etc
  * city streets
  * national parks
  * reservations
* and more!
