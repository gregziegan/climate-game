# Writing Guide

This guide will onboard any volunteer who'd like to add an educational conversation about climate change into this game.

## Where to start

Think of a topic you are passionate about with respect to [climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change#Physical_drivers_of_recent_climate_change). It doesn't need to be as direct as pollution, deforestation, etc.

## Research

Read about [climate change mitigation techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation) and pick a relevant action. We can simulate almost any policy action in our game (behind the scenes we're combining statistical data to create really rough approximations and visualizations)!

### Feedback

From here, you can start writing immediately or seek early feedback on your idea! Feel free to join the [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/Wu9ZK9) to chat about the idea. If you'd rather chat via longer messages like email, we'd prefer it to happen on our Issues tab. [Follow this link](/issues/new?assignees=&labels=script&template=script-idea.md&title=) to propose your early idea! Contributors will then read and comment on your submission.

## Characters

You can use existing fictional characters that are described in the [characters spreadsheet](./characters.csv) or invent a new one!

Consider using characters who'd have a vested interest in the policy they're discussing with you. You could write about a fossil fuel executive pressuring you for land privatization. Or, an indigenous activist trying to stop said executive from destroying their land. It'd be fine to write both or put them all in the same conversation!

## Writing

Describe what decisions the player can make. We can "write policy" by chatting with other characters. The conversation should flow while being both engaging and understandable for kids (in this first release). Policies can be really simple: 1 decision, two options, and a little small talk before and after the decision.

### Reading Level

Try to write at a reading level no higher than 6 or 7. Products like [Microsoft Word](http://facultyweb.ivcc.edu/rrambo/eng1001/reading_level.htm) can help you here.
Some simple tips are: use short words and short sentences.

Our first audience is actually K-4. This offers the writer a unique challenge! You'll need to explain complex situations in simple terms. Conversations will probably not sound realitic and that's OK! The goal is to give the player 1) a choice 2) a reason and 3) a different game depending on their choice.

## Example

Browse this [example script](./example-script.md). This will be updated as we get better script writers!
