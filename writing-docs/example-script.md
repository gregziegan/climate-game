## Script

SCENE: outside the office of the president

Aliyah: [INTO MEGAPHONE] President ..., we need help now! My family and friends are sick! Our water is brown. My kids can't play outside in the smog.

President:

A1: How can I help?
B1: What needs to be done?

Aliyah: The <insert-name> coal plant must be shut down!

President:

A2: Why?
B2: Many people in your city work at ... coal plant. What would they do instead?

If A2:

Aliyah: The coal plant gives us jobs and power. But, the plant harms our land and air. We want cleaner power!

If B2:

Aliyah: They can work at a new plant. We can use solar or wind energy!

President:

A3: Please write to your representative. I need to go! (Decision 1)
B3: I will ask the plant owners to change the power source.
C3: I am signing a bill today that gives your city new trains. Maybe we can move your neighborhood away from the coal plant? (Decision 4)

If A3: end conversation with another statement from Aliyah of frustration

If B3:

Aliyah: How?

President:

A4: They will lose money to higher taxes if they do not change to cleaner power. (Decision 2)
B4: We will give them money to change how they make power. (Decision 3)

If C3:

Aliyah: We don't want to move. We will need new houses and schools!

President: We know this is not easy but it is the best we can do!
